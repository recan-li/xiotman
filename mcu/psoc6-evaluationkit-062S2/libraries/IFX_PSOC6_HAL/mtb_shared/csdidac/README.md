# Cypress CSDIDAC Middleware Library

### Overview
The CSDIDAC provides an API that allows the CSD HW block IDAC functionality.
It can be useful for devices that do not include other DAC options. 

### Features
* A two-channel IDAC with the 7-bit resolution
* The IDAC A and IDAC B channels can be enabled/disabled independently
* The IDAC A and IDAC B channels can be configured with sourcing/sinking current independently
* The IDAC A and IDAC B channels can be joined to increase a maximum output current
* The IDAC A and IDAC B channels can be enabled/disabled simultaneously by using the CY_CSDIDAC_AB option
* The 0 to 609.6 uA (609600 nA) current range is available for each IDAC channel
* Each IDAC can use independently one of the six available LSB depending on a desired output current

### Quick Start
The CSDIDAC could be configured by the ModusToolbox CSD personality. Refer to the [API Reference Guide Configuration Considerations](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/csdidac/csdidac_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#group_csdidac_configuration).
