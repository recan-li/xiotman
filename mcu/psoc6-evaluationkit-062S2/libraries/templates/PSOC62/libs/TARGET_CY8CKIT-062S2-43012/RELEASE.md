# CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 BSP Release Notes
The CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 PSoC™ 6S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC™ 6 MCUs. It comes with a Murata 1LV Module (CYW43012 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth Combo Chip), industry-leading CAPSENSE™ for touch buttons and slider, on-board debugger/programmer with KitProg3, microSD card interface, 512-Mb Quad-SPI NOR flash, PDM-PCM microphone interface.

NOTE: BSPs are versioned by family. This means that version 1.2.0 of any BSP in a family (eg: PSoC™ 6) will have the same software maturity level. However, not all updates are necessarily applicable for each BSP in the family so not all version numbers will exist for each board. Additionally, new BSPs may not start at version 1.0.0. In the event of adding a common feature across all BSPs, the libraries are assigned the same version number. For example if BSP_A is at v1.3.0 and BSP_B is at v1.2.0, the event will trigger a version update to v1.4.0 for both BSP_A and BSP_B. This allows the common feature to be tracked in a consistent way.

### What's Included?
The CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
* cybsp_types.h file describing basic board setup
* CM4 Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, and ARM toolchains
* CM0+ Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, and ARM toolchains
* Configurator design files (and generated code) to setup board specific peripherals
* .lib file references for all dependent libraries
* API documentation

### What Changed?
#### v4.1.0
* Add macro `CYBSP_USER_BTN_DRIVE` indicating the drive mode that should be used for user buttons
* PSoC 64 boards: Fix cybsp_init not recognizing that a prebuilt CM0+ image is in use when using TFM.
#### v4.0.0
Note: This revision is only compatible with ModusToolbox Tools 3.0 and newer.
* Removed default dependency on CAPSENSE™ middleware. The library manager can be used to add this dependency if desired.
* Updated recipe-make, core-make, and PDL to new major versions
* Regenerated code with Configurators from ModusToolbox™ v3.0.0
* Renamed top level board makefile to bsp.mk
* Removed version.xml file in favor of new props.json
#### v3.1.0
* Added optional macro CYBSP_CUSTOM_SYSCLK_PM_CALLBACK to allow overriding default clock power management behavior.
* Enable AIROC™ BLE stack for MCUs with an integrated BLE radio
#### v3.0.0
* Updated to HAL dependency to v2.0.0
* Updated CAPSENSE™ dependency to v3.0.0
* Regenerated code with Configurators from ModusToolbox™ v2.4.0
#### v2.3.0
* Add new connectivity components for easier board customization
* Simplify BT configuration settings for boards that support it
* Minor branding updates
#### v2.2.0
* Updated PSoC™ 64 linker sections to match secure policy settings
* Minor documentation updates
#### v2.1.0
* Added component CAT1 to all boards
* Added new components for connectivity chips
* Added BT configuration settings for boards that support it
* Minor documentation updates
#### v2.0.1
* Minor update to better handle when to include the SCL library in the build
#### v2.0.0
* Updated design files and GeneratedSource with ModusToolbox™ 2.2 release
* Migrated pin definitions into design.modus file
* Updated clock frequencies to 100 MHz (fast) / 50 MHz (slow)
* Updated MPNs on some boards to non-obsolete parts
* Switched psoc6pdl dependency to new mtb-pdl
* Switched psoc6hal dependency to new mtb-hal
* Switched psoc6make dependency to new core-make & recipe-make-cat1a
NOTE: This version requires ModusToolbox™ tools 2.2 or later. This version is not backwards compatible with 1.X versions. Additional manual steps must be taken to successfully update a design using a 1.x version of the BSP to this version.
#### v1.3.0
* Minor update for documentation & branding
* Updated design files to use latest personality files
* Initialize VDDA voltage if set in configurator
NOTE: This requires psoc6hal 1.3.0 or later
#### v1.2.1
* Added 43012/4343W/43438 component to appropriate BSPs
* Added multi-image policy for secure (064) BSPs
#### v1.2.0
* Standardize version numbering for all boards in a family
* Moved UDB SDIO implementation into its own library udb-sdio-whd library
* Added call to setup HAL SysPM driver (requires HAL 1.2.0 or later)
* Updated documentation
NOTE: This requires psoc6hal 1.2.0 or later
#### v1.1.0
* Updated linker scripts and startup code for the CM0+ and CM4 cores. The files are now in core specific directories.
* Minor updates to avoid potential warnings on some toolchains
#### v1.0.1
* Added pin references for the board's J2 Header (for appropriate boards)
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release
